### Exercises


# ------------ part 1 ------------ #

# (a)
# A sample of fish were aged, and the associated counts are given in the
# vector below.  Modify this line of code to store this vector to a variable
# named "counts_by_age".
c(42, 81, 19, 12, 7)

# (b)
# We will estimate the proportions of each age, but first, use the sum() function
# to calculate the total of counts_by_age.
## Answer: 161


# (c)
# Store this to a new variable named "n".


# (d)
# Now, calculate a vector of estimated proportions, calculated as counts/total.
# Store this to a new variable named "p_hat".
## Answer: 0.26086957 0.50310559 0.11801242 0.07453416 0.04347826


# (e)
# Calculate the estimated variance of the proportions.  The formula is
# p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / (n - 1)
## Answer: 0.0012051040 0.0015624397 0.0006505343 0.0004311176 0.0002599244


# (f)
# Now, calculate the standard error of the proportions.  Remember: SE = sqrt(V_hat).
# Add a comment to clarify the calculation, in case someone is reading your code
# who doesn't know the relationship between estimated variance and standard error.
## Answer: 0.03471461 0.03952771 0.02550557 0.02076337 0.01612217


# Yay for vector math!  Note that non-specific names such as "n", "p_hat", etc.
# aren't always the best choices for programming, but these will likely match
# the equations in an Operational Plan.




# ------------ part 2 ------------ #

# Total catch and hours fished are recorded for 5 vessels below.
total_catch <- c(234, 564, 123, 87, 345)
hours_fished <- c(12, 24, 36, NA, 48)      # number 4 forgot to record it
vessel_name <- c("Alexander the Grape",
                 "Billy Bob's Bastion of Buoyancy",
                 "Classical Classifier",
                 "Dramamine Drama",
                 "Empress of Empiricality")

# (a)
# Calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE) for all 5 vessels (hint: total/hours)
## Answer: 19.500000 23.500000  3.416667        NA  7.187500

# (b)
# Use the mean() function to calculate the average CPUE for non-missing data.
# To do this, add an argument to mean() to remove the NA.  If you don't remember
# the argument to add, try running help(mean) or ?mean in the console.
## Answer: 13.40104




# ------------ part 3 ------------ #

# (a)
# Try running the following code.  Resist the urge to add the missing parenthesis.
something <- (1 + 1
              
# Note that the usual ">" thing and the cursor are missing.
# Click in the Console and hit the <esc> key.  Whew!

# Note: trying to run any code after this line probably would have errored and
# escaped the uneven parentheses, but <esc> is the cleanest.



# (b)
# Now try running this.
while(TRUE) cat(sample(0:9, 1))

# Try not to panic and click the friendly red stop sign :)

x <- sample(-500:100, 35)
while(TRUE) {
  x <- x-1
  x[x < -500] <- sample(100:200, sum(x < -500))
  y <- ifelse(x > 0, sample(0:9, sum(x > 0), replace = TRUE), " ")
  cat(paste(y, collapse=""), "\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.02)
}


x <- seq(0, 2.5, length.out=7)
while(TRUE) {
  cat(paste(ifelse(1:60 %in% round(30 * sin(x) + 30), "*", " "), collapse = ""), "\n")
  x <- x + seq(0.06, 0.1, length.out=7) #0.08   ### haha try seq() or even rnorm() here
  Sys.sleep(0.02)
}



while(TRUE) {
  cat(paste(ifelse(1:60 %in% round(30 * (1 + sin(3*as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())$sec + (1:8)/3))), "*", " "), collapse = ""), "\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.02)
}


# ------------ Bonus! ------------ #

# Load the vector of lengths below.
length_cm <- c(22, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 30, 30, 32,
               34, 37, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 47, 49, 49)

# (a)
# Create a vector of binned lengths using the cut() function.  Inspect this
# new vector and see what the cut() function did.
length_cm_cut <- cut(length_cm, breaks = c(20, 30, 40, 50))

# (b)
# What kind of variable is length_cm_cut?


# (c)
# Tabulate (count) the totals in each 10-cm category using the table() function.
table(length_cm_cut)


# (d)
# Inspect the length measurements (length_cm) again.  How did cut() handle
# measurements that were equal to values in breaks=?


# (e)
# Okay, that's a little annoying, since our tables are typically closed on the
# left instead of the right; in this case we might want:
# 20 <= length_cm < 30 (including 20 but not including 30)
# 30 <= length_cm < 40 (including 30 but not including 40), etc.

# Look at ?cut.  Modify the code below, changing the default value of right=
# to make the table more ADFG-typical.
## Answer:
## length_cm_cut
## [20,30) [30,40) [40,50)
##       6       9       5
length_cm_cut <- cut(length_cm, breaks = c(20, 30, 40, 50))
table(length_cm_cut)
