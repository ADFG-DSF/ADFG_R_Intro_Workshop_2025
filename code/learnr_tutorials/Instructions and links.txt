These tutorials were created for the 2023 iteration of the Intro to R class, and
can be run on your computer by navigating to the appropriate folder and opening
the .Rmd file inside.  Click on a button near the top that says "Run Document".
If there is a message saying additional packages need to be installed (possibly
knitr and learnr), go ahead and install them as needed.

There is not a complete correspondence between the 2023 and 2025 versions of the
course, but hopefully these should provide some additional practice as desired!

If you run into problems running the tutorials on your computer, they are also
available online at the following links:
