#### ⚙️ Your Turn (Set Up)

First step is always load the necessary packages. Insert a code chunk below (**Ctrl + Alt + I**), and load the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages using `library()`.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Next we can take a look at the data structure. It may help to reference column names that you are interested in visualizing.  

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
## 🖼️ Your Turn 1
  
Follow the code on the slide to make your first `ggplot`. Remember that R is case sensitive.  

```{r}

```

Each element of the plot is a layer and we can stack many layers together. Lets try adding in another layer to draw in a regression line. Use `+` at the end of your last function to add another layer and type in: `geom_smooth(method = "lm, se = FALSE)`  
For this layer we will use `method = "lm"` to specify we want a linear model, and `se = FALSE` to turn off the the confidence interval visual. Use `?geom_smooth` to see more options.

```{r}
#Copy your code to draw the scatter plot, then add a new layer using +
#geom_smooth(method = "lm, se = FALSE)


```
  
Wow! it appears that as bill length increases, bill depth decreases... strange  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
There are many other types of `geoms` you can use! Try a few out.  
  
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = penguins) #creates the base plot 

#barplot
p + geom_bar(aes(x=flipper_length_mm))

#boxplot
p + geom_boxplot(aes(x=species,y = body_mass_g))

#density plot
p + geom_density(aes(x = body_mass_g))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
## 📊 Your turn 2  
  
Go ahead and create a `boxplot` of **flipper_length_mm** (y) by **island** (x) and `color` (or `fill =`) by **species**.  

```{r}

```
  
Interesting. It appears that Adelie species is present on all three islands whereas Gentoo's are only found on Biscoe, and Chinstrap's are only found on Dream.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Go ahead and experiment with other *aesthetics* and *geoms\_*. Some options include: `aes(x = ,y = , color = , fill = , size = , shape = , alpha = , linetype = )`  

```{r}

```
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------  

When you are satisfied, lets revisit our regression line from earlier. Lets now color our points by `species` and redraw the regression. Fill in the blanks:

```{r}
ggplot(data = ______, mapping = aes(x = ______,
                                    y = ______,
                                    color = ______))+
  geom_*****()+
  geom_smooth(method = "__", se = _____)
```
  
Whew. That makes a lot more sense. Now a separate regression line is fit for each `color` (species). We see now that as bill length increases, so does bill depth. Bonus points if you know the name of this paradox -- share it in the chat!  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now lets see what happens when we place the mapping of aesthetics directly in the `geom_` function rather than within the `ggplot(`) function. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                                      y = bill_depth_mm))+ # No color mapped globally in ggplot()
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species))+ #color is mapped within geom_point() instead
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) #geom_smooth no longer fits to each species, but rather globally


# You can try adding in size = sex, or shape = sex within the geom_point layer too.
```

🔑 Mappings (and data) that appear **inside** of `ggplot()` will apply globally to every layer. Whereas, mappings (and data) that appear **inside** a `geom_` function will add to or override the global mappings for that layer only.

## #️⃣ Your turn 3

Go ahead and experiment with a few facet options. Try different combinations of `geoms_` and the variables `island`, `sex`, `species`, or `year`.  
  
Use `facet_wrap(~Variable1)` to facet by one variable Use `facet_grid(Variable1~Variable2)` to create sub plots for each combination of your two variables.  
  
You can also use the `labs()` function to add labels to your plot. For example:  
`labs(title = "Scatter plot X~Y ", x = "rename X-axis", y = "rename Y-Axis", etc )`  

```{r}
# To see the help documentation
# ?facet_grid
# ?facet_wrap
# ?labs()



```

## 🎨 Final Challenge: Create and Share Your Own ggplot

Now it’s your turn! Put your `ggplot2` skills into action by creating your **own custom plot**.  
You’ll design it, save it, and then share it with the class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 🧠 Helpful Resources

-   📄 [**ggplot2 Cheatsheet (HTML version)**](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html)
-   📘 [**ggplot2 Reference Site**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
-   🔎 Use `?geom_point`, `?facet_wrap`, etc. in the Console for quick help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1️⃣ Choose a dataset

You can use one of these built-in datasets in R or `ggplot2`:

-   `penguins` – Measurements for 3 penguin species (body size, island, sex, etc.) from Antarctica
-   `iris` – Classic dataset with petal/sepal measurements for 3 flower species
-   `diamonds` – Nearly 54,000 diamonds with cut, color, clarity, carat, and price
-   `mpg` – Fuel economy data for various car models (engine size, class, highway mpg)
-   `mtcars` – Vintage car specs (e.g., cylinders, horsepower, transmission)
-   `starwars` – Info on Star Wars characters (height, mass, homeworld, species, etc.)

use `glimpse(dataset)`, `str(data)`, or `head(data)` to get an idea of the data sets structure.  
  
Initialize plot: `ggplot(data = )`

#### 2️⃣ Map aesthetics with aes()

Decide what variables you want to visualize.

`mapping = aes(x = ,y = ,color = ,fill = ,size = ,shape = ,alpha = , fill = )`

#### 3️⃣ Choose your geometric objec (geom_*())

Think about how your data should be represented:

-   `geom_point()` # Scatterplot
-   `geom_bar()` # Bar chart (requires just x)
-   `geom_boxplot()` # Boxplot
-   `geom_histogram()` # Histogram (requires just x)
-   `geom_line()` # Line chart
-   `geom_xxxx` # Many more to explore

#### 4️⃣ Add custom features (optional but encouraged!)

Make your plot your own by exploring these:

**Faceting:**  
- `facet_wrap(~ variable)` #1d ribbon  
  
- `facet_grid(row ~ col)` #2d grid of rows ~ columns

**Coordinate systems:**  

-`coord_flip()` – flip axes

-`coord_polar()` – radial layout  

**Scaling:**    
**Try using `scale_color_manual()`, `scale_size_continuous()`, or `scale_x_binned()`, etc

**Themes:**  
Apply a built-in theme like `theme_minimal()`, `theme_classic()`, or `theme_bw()`

**Position:**  
`position = "stack"` - default  
`position = "fill"` - stack overlapping, scaled to 1  
`position = "dodge"` - place overlapping parts side-by-side  
`position = "jitter"` - for geom point, adds random noise to each point.  
`geom_jitter()` does the same thing.

**Labels:**  

`+ labs(...)`  
`title = "My Plot"`  
`subtitle = "Subtitle of my plot"`  
`x = "Rename X-axis"`  
`y = "Rename Y-axis"`  
`color = "New legend title for color"`  
`shape = "New legend title for shape"`  
`size = "New legend title for size" `  

#### 5️⃣ Save your plot as an object  

Store your plot as an object in your environment so you can view it later:  

`my_plot <- ggplot(...) + ...`  

#### 6️⃣ Export your plot with ggsave()  

`ggsave("my_plot.png", my_plot, width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)`  

📌 This saves the plot as an image (.png) in your working directory. Make sure the file name ends in .png, .jpg, or .pdf depending on what format you want.  

#### 7️⃣ Share your plot!  

🎉 Post your saved image (or a screenshot) in the teams chat. (you can also just right-click and copy-paste your plot)  

#### 8️⃣ Knit your project! 

🧶 When you're done with your plot, **click the "Knit"** button at the top of RStudio, or use the keyboard shortcut: *Ctrl + Shift + K*.  

This will render your .Rmd into an HTML report with all your code, text, and your final plot!
